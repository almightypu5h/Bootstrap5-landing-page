# Responsive Landing Page Project

This project is a responsive landing page built using Bootstrap and customized with SASS. It showcases my skills in front-end development, specifically utilizing Bootstrap for rapid prototyping and SASS for more efficient CSS styling.

## Features

- Responsive design: The landing page adjusts its layout and elements to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.
- Customized Bootstrap components: I've customized Bootstrap components to match the design and branding requirements of the landing page.
- SASS integration: By using SASS, I've organized and modularized the CSS code, making it more maintainable and scalable.
- Clean and well-structured code: The HTML, CSS (SASS), and JavaScript files are organized and documented for easy readability and maintenance.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: Semantic markup for the structure of the landing page.
- CSS3/SASS: Styling and layout customization, utilizing SASS for enhanced capabilities such as variables, mixins, and nesting.
- Bootstrap: A front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.

## Usage

To view the landing page:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Explore the responsive design and interactivity of the landing page.

## Customization

To customize the landing page:

1. Modify the HTML structure and content in the `index.html` file.
2. Customize the styles in the `styles.scss` file using SASS syntax.
3. Add or modify JavaScript functionality in the `script.js` file.
4. Re-compile the SASS files into CSS using a SASS compiler if necessary.

## Acknowledgments

This project was built as part of my learning journey in front-end development. I would like to thank the Bootstrap and SASS communities for their excellent documentation and resources that helped me understand and implement these technologies effectively.
